Distributed Resource Scheduler
==============================

The **OpenNebula Distributed Resource Scheduler** (DRS) is responsible for:

* Initial placement of virtual machines according to the system requirements, including: capacity control, resource compatibility, and affinity groups
* Cluster-wise workload optimization, according to the balancing policies specified by the user

Scheduling Algorithm
====================

OpenNebula DRS uses the integer linear programming (ILP) optimizer.
Details about host filtering, storage, VNets, PCI devices, etc.

Configuration
=============

The Front-End configuration file of DRS is ``/etc/one/schedulers/one_drs.conf``. Its options are:

* ``DEFAULT_SCHED``: Default ILP solver used for scheduling. See `Solvers`_ for more details.
* ``PLACE``: Settings for the initial placement of virtual machines. See `Scheduling Policies`_ for more details.
* ``OPTIMIZE``: Settings for workload optimization. See `Scheduling Policies`_ for more details.
* ``PREDICTIVE``: Weight of forecasted resource usage in the scheduling process. For example, the value ``0.3`` means that the predicted resource usage is accounted with 30% and current usage with 70%. See `Predictive DRS`_ for more details.
* ``MEMORY_SYSTEM_DS_SCALE``: Scaling factor for the system datastore usage by a virtual machine, according to the size of memory. It can be applied to force the scheduler to consider the overhead of checkpoint files.
* ``DIFFERENT_VNETS``: Whether all NICs of a virtual machine should be assigned to different virtual networks. The allowed options are ``YES`` and ``NO``.

This is an example of a configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    DEFAULT_SCHED:
      SOLVER: "CBC"
      SOLVER_PATH: "/usr/lib/one/python/pulp/solverdir/cbc/linux/64/cbc"

    PLACE:
      POLICY: "PACK"

    OPTIMIZE:
      POLICY: "BALANCE"
      MIGRATION_THRESHOLD: 10
      WEIGHTS:
        CPU_USAGE: 0.2
        CPU: 0.2
        MEMORY: 0.4
        DISK: 0.1
        NET: 0.1

    PREDICTIVE: 0.3

    MEMORY_SYSTEM_DS_SCALE: 0

    DIFFERENT_VNETS: YES

Solvers
=======

OpenNebula DRS uses the Python package PuLP to communicate with ILP solvers. It can use any `solver supported by PuLP <https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/technical/solvers.html>`_. Currently, DRS comes with `GLPK Solver <https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/>`_, but a user can also install and apply `CBC Solver <https://coin-or.github.io/Cbc/>`_, or some commercial solver like `Gurobi Optimizer <https://www.gurobi.com/>`_.

Solver options are configured in the ``DEFAULT_SCHED`` section of the configuration file. The available settings are:

* ``SOLVER``: Name of the solver, e.g. ``"GLPK"``, ``"CBC"``, or ``"COINMP"``.
* ``SOLVER_PATH``: Path to the solver library.
